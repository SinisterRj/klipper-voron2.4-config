# garethky/klipper-voron2.4-config/nextruder-hx711

A very experimental branch that mounts a Prusa Nextruder onto a Voron 2.4 as a test platform for my work on probing with load cells.

This also gets an upgrade to an Octopus Prom, sensorless homing x & y.

So yeah, maybe don't use this for your own machine just yet...
